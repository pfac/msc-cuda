So far, all described implementations were first implemented in a multi-core environment, using point and block methods. The next step focused on the scalability study of the algorithm: in \cite{Deadman:Higham:Ralha:2013}, the authors performed tests using the full parallelism supported by the hardware and the sequential version; no tests were performed to verify how the execution time changes as the number of threads increases.
These results help to plan efficient implementations with hardware accelerators. In particular, it is relevant to find bottlenecks as this will condition further algorithm optimizations to explore massive parallelism.
